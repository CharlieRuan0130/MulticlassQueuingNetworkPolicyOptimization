@article{DaiShi2016,
	Abstract = { We analyze a time-varying Mperi/Geo2timeScale/N queueing system. The arrival process is periodic Poisson. The service time of a customer has components in different time scales: length of stay (LOS) in days and departure time (hdis) in hours. This queueing system has been used to study patient flows from the emergency department (ED) to hospital inpatient wards. In that setting, the LOS of a patient is simply the number of days she spends in a ward, and her departure time hdis is the discharge hour on the day of her discharge. We develop a new analytical framework that can perform exact analysis on this novel queueing system. This framework has two steps: first analyze the midnight customer count process and obtain its stationary distribution, then analyze the time-dependent customer count process to compute various performance measures. We also develop approximation tools that can significantly reduce the computational time. In particular, via Stein's method, we derive explicit expressions to approximate the stationary distribution of the midnight count. We provide error bounds for these approximations and numerically demonstrate that they are remarkably accurate for systems with various sizes and load conditions. Our theoretical and numerical analysis have produced a number of insights that can be used to improve hospital inpatient flow management. We find that the LOS term affects the overnight wait caused by the mismatch between daily arrivals and discharges, whereas the hdis term affects the intraday wait caused by the nonsynchronization between the arrival and discharge time patterns. Thus, reducing LOS or increasing capacity can impact the daily average performance significantly; shifting the discharge timing to earlier times of a day can alleviate the peak congestion in the morning and mainly affects the time-dependent performance.

@article{KobaSakuMiya2013,
	Abstract = {We are concerned with an $M/M$-type join the shortest queue ($M/M$-JSQ for short) with $k$ parallel queues for an arbitrary positive integer $k$, where the servers may be heterogeneous. We are interested in the tail asymptotic of the stationary distribution of this queueing model, provided the system is stable. We prove that this asymptotic for the minimum queue length is exactly geometric, and its decay rate is the $k$-th power of the traffic intensity of the corresponding $k$ server queues with a single waiting line. For this, we use two formulations, a quasi-birth-and-death (QBD for short) process and a reflecting random walk on the boundary of the $k+1$-dimensional orthant. The QBD process is typically used in the literature for studying the JSQ with 2 parallel queues, but the random walk also plays a key roll in our arguments, which enables us to use the existing results on tail asymptotics for the QBD process.},

	Abstract = {{In this paper we study a single-server queue where the inter-arrival
   times and the service times depend on a common discrete time Markov
   chain. This model generalizes the well-known MAP/G/1 queue by allowing
   dependencies between inter-arrival and service times. The waiting time
   process is directly analyzed by solving Lindley's equation by transform
   methods. The Laplace-Stieltjes transforms (LST) of the steady-state
   waiting time and queue length distribution are both derived, and used
   to obtain recursive equations for the calculation of the moments.
   Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effect of the
   autocorrelation of and the cross-correlation between the inter-arrival

	Abstract = {{Call centers are an increasingly important part of today's business
   world, employing millions of agents across the globe and serving as a
   primary customer-facing channel for firms in many different industries.
   Call centers have been a fertile area for operations management
   researchers in several domains, including forecasting, capacity
   planning, queueing, and personnel scheduling. In addition, as
   telecommunications and information technology have advanced over the
   past several years, the operational challenges faced by call center
   managers have become more complicated. Issues associated with human
   resources management, sales, and marketing have also become
   increasingly relevant to call center operations and associated academic
   research.
   In this paper, we provide a survey of the recent literature on call
   center operations management. Along with traditional research areas, we
   pay special attention to new management challenges that have been
   caused by emerging technologies, to behavioral issues associated with
   both call center agents and customers, and to the interface between
   call center operations and sales and marketing. We identify a handful
   of broad themes for future investigation while also pointing out
   several very specific research opportunities.}},

@article{ArmoPlamSesh2009,
	Abstract = {{This paper employs sample path arguments to derive the following
   convexity properties and comparative statics for an M/M/S queue with
   impatient customers. If the rate at which customers balk and renege is
   an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the
   system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate
   of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate
   or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot
   observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the
   reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal
   capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic
   in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the
   reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further
   increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand
   customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but
   customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a
   degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent
   customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or
   training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's
   convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative
   statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging
   during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost
   sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or
   number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal
   capacity when capacity is cheap.}},

@article{BertGamaRiku2011,
	Abstract = {{Performance analysis of queueing networks is one of the most
   challenging areas of queueing theory. Barring very specialized models
   such as product-form type queueing networks, there exist very few
   results that provide provable nonasymptotic upper and lower bounds on
   key performance measures.
   In this paper we propose a new performance analysis method, which is
   based on the robust optimization. The basic premise of our approach is
   as follows: rather than assuming that the stochastic primitives of a
   queueing model satisfy certain probability laws-such as i.i.d.
   interarrival and service times distributions-we assume that the
   underlying primitives are deterministic and satisfy the implications of
   such probability laws. These implications take the form of simple
   linear constraints, namely, those motivated by the law of the iterated
   logarithm (LIL). Using this approach we are able to obtain performance
   bounds on some key performance measures. Furthermore, these performance
   bounds imply similar bounds in the underlying stochastic queueing
   models.
   We demonstrate our approach on two types of queueing networks: (a)
   tandem single-class queueing network and (b) multiclass single-server
   queueing network. In both cases, using the proposed robust optimization
   approach, we are able to obtain explicit upper bounds on some
   steady-state performance measures. For example, for the case of TSC
   system we obtain a bound of the form C(1 - rho)(-1) ln ln (1 -
   rho)(-1)) on the expected steady-state sojourn time, where C is an
   explicit constant and rho is the bottleneck traffic intensity. This
   qualitatively agrees with the correct heavy traffic scaling of this
   performance measure up to the ln ln((1 - rho)(-1)) correction factor.}},

	Abstract = {{We consider a class of queueing systems that consist of server pools in
   parallel and multiple customer classes. Customer service times are
   assumed to be exponentially distributed. We study the asymptotic
   behavior of these queueing systems in a heavy traffic regime that is
   known as the Halfin-Whitt many-server asymptotic regime. Our main
   contribution is a general framework for establishing state space
   collapse results in this regime for parallel server systems. In our
   work, state space collapse refers to a decrease in the dimension of the
   processes tracking the number of customers in each class waiting for
   service and the number of customers in each class being served by
   various server pools. We define and introduce a ``state space
   collapse{''} function, which governs the exact details of the state
   space collapse. We show that a state space collapse result holds in
   many-server heavy traffic if a corresponding deterministic hydrodynamic
   model satisfies a similar state space collapse condition. Unlike the
   single-server heavy traffic setting for multiclass queueing network,
   our hydrodynamic model is different from the standard fluid model for
   many-server queues. Our methodology is similar in spirit to that in
   Bramson {[}Bramson, M. 1998. State space collapse with application to
   heavy traffic limits for multiclass queueing networks. Queueing Systems
   30 89-148.], which focuses on the single-server heavy traffic regime.
   We illustrate the applications of our results by establishing state
   space collapse results in many-server diffusion limits for V-model
   systems under static-buffer-priority policy and the threshold policy
   proposed in the literature.}},

	Abstract = {This paper develops methods to determine appropriate staffing levels in call centers and other many-server queueing systems with time-varying arrival rates. The goal is to achieve targeted time-stable performance, even in the presence of significant time variation in the arrival rates. The main contribution is a flexible simulation-based iterative-staffing algorithm (ISA) for the Mt/G/st + G model--with nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process (the Mt) and customer abandonment (the + G). For Markovian Mt/M/st + M special cases, the ISA is shown to converge. For that Mt/M/st + M model, simulation experiments show that the ISA yields time-stable delay probabilities across a wide range of target delay probabilities. With ISA, other performance measures--such as agent utilizations, abandonment probabilities, and average waiting times--are stable as well. The ISA staffing and performance agree closely with the modified-offered-load approximation, which was previously shown to be an effective staffing algorithm without customer abandonment. Although the ISA algorithm so far has only been extensively tested for Mt/M/st + M models, it can be applied much more generally--to Mt/G/st + G models and beyond.

   arriving customers, there are negative arrivals.  A negative arrival
   has the effect of removing a customer from the queue.  The way in which
   this removal is specified gives rise to several different models.
   Unlike the standard FIFO GI/GI/1 model, the stability conditions for
   these new models may depend upon more than just the arrival and service
   rates; the entire distributions of interarrival and service times may
   be involved.}},

@article{Gras1988,
	Abstract = {Real-life queuing problems tend to be complex and ill-defined, and exact mathematical approaches are therefore illusory. This has to be taken into account when one wants to determine the right number of servers in a real-life queuing system, a problem of considerable practical importance. We suggest a number of approaches to find the number of servers. These approaches are both simple and flexible enough to cover a wide variety of queuing situations. Most of these approaches are based on the normal distribution, and their derivation is similar to the one used in one-period inventory models. Formulas based on classical queuing equations are also discussed.

	Abstract = {An important problem in the theory of dynamic programming is that of characterizing sufficient conditions under which the optimal policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the infinite-horizon discounted cost criterion converge to an optimal policy under the average cost criterion as the discount factor approaches 1. In this paper, we provide, for stochastic inventory models, a set of such sufficient conditions. These conditions, unlike many others in the dynamic programming literature, hold when the action space is noncompact and the underlying transition law is weakly continuous. Moreover, we verify that these conditions hold for almost all conceivable single-stage inventory models with few assumptions on cost and demand parameters. As a consequence of our analysis, we partially characterize, for the first time, optimal policies for the following inventory systems under the infinite-horizon average-cost criterion, which have thus far been a challenge: (a) capacitated systems with setup costs, (b) uncapacitated systems with convex ordering costs plus a setup cost, and (c) systems with lost sales and lead times.

@article{MandZelt2009,
	Abstract = {{Motivated by call center practice, we study asymptotically optimal
   staffing of many-server queues with abandonment. A call center is
   modelled as an M/M/n+G queue, which is characterized by Poisson
   arrivals, exponential service times, n servers, and generally
   distributed patience times of customers. Our asymptotic analysis is
   performed as the arrival rate, and hence the number of servers n,
   increases indefinitely.
   We consider a constraint satisfaction problem, where one chooses the
   minimal staffing level n that adheres to a given cost constraint. The
   cost can incorporate the fraction abandoning, average wait, and tail
   probabilities of wait. Depending on the cost, several operational
   regimes arise as asymptotically optimal: Efficiency-Driven (ED),
   Quality and Efficiency-Driven (QED), and also a new ED+QED operational
   regime that enables QED tuning of the ED regime. Numerical experiments
   demonstrate that, over a wide range of system parameters, our
   approximations provide useful insight as well as excellent fit to exact
   optimal solutions. It turns out that the QED regime is preferable
   either for small-to-moderate call centers or for large call centers
   with relatively tight performance constraints. The other two regimes
   are more appropriate for large call centers with loose constraints.
   We consider two versions of the constraint satisfaction problem. The
   first one is constraint satisfaction on a single time interval, say one
   hour, which is common in practice. Of special interest is a constraint
   on the tail probability, in which case our new ED+QED staffing turns
   out asymptotically optimal. We also address a global constraint
   problem, say over a full day. Here several time intervals, say 24
   hours, are considered, with interval-dependent staffing levels allowed;
   one seeks to minimize staffing levels, or more generally costs, given
   the overall performance constraint. In this case, there is the added
   flexibility of trading service levels among time intervals, but we
   demonstrate that only little gain is associated with this flexibility
   if one is concerned with the fraction abandoning.}},

	Abstract = {{We show that using the FIFO service discipline at single server
   stations with ILR (increasing likelihood ratio) service time
   distributions in networks of monotone queues results in stochastically
   earlier departures throughout the network. The converse is true at
   stations with DLR (decreasing likelihood ratio) service time
   distributions. We use these results to establish the validity of the
   following comparisons: (i) The throughput of a closed network of FIFO
   single-server queues will be larger (smaller) when the service times
   are ILR (DLR) rather than exponential with the same means. (ii) The
   total stationary number of customers in an open network of FIFO
   single-server queues with Poisson external arrivals will be
   stochastically smaller (larger) when the service times are ILR (DLR)
   rather than exponential with the same means.
   We also give a surprising counterexample to show that although FIFO
   stochastically maximizes the number of departures by any time t from an
   isolated single-server queue with IHR (increasing hazard rate, which is
   weaker than ILR) service times, this is no longer true for networks of
   more than one queue. Thus the ILR assumption cannot be relaxed to IHR.
   Finally, we consider multiclass networks of exponential single-server
   queues, where the class of a customer at a particular station
   determines its service rate at that station, and show that serving the
   customer with the highest service rate (which is SEPT - shortest
   expected processing time first) results in stochastically earlier
   departures throughout the network, among all preemptive work-conserving
   policies. We also show that a cu rule stochastically maximizes the
   number of non-defective service completions by any time t when there
   are random, agreeable, yields.}},

	Abstract = {We explore the issues of when and how to partition arriving customers into service groups that will be served separately, in a first-come first-served manner, by multiserver service systems having a provision for waiting, and how to assign an appropriate number of servers to each group. We assume that customers can be classified upon arrival, so that different service groups can have different service-time distributions. We provide methodology for quantifying the tradeoff between economies of scale associated with larger systems and the benefit of having customers with shorter service times separated from other customers with longer service times, as is done in service systems with express lines. To properly quantify this tradeoff, it is important to characterize service-time distributions beyond their means. In particular, it is important to also determine the variance of the service-time distribution of each service group. Assuming Poisson arrival processes, we then can model the congestion experienced by each server group as an M/G/squeue with unlimited waiting room. We use previously developed approximations for M/G/sperformance measures to quickly evaluate alternative partitions.

	Abstract = {{The system under consideration comprises two classes of customers to be
   served by two stations, with parallel servers in each station. While
   class-1 customers can only receive service from station 1, class-2
   customers can be served by either station. Arrival processes of
   customers form two mutually independent Poisson processes. The service
   time of a customer at either station is exponentially distributed with
   a common rate. A class-i customer, while present in the system, will
   incur a holding cost h(i) with h1 greater-than-or-equal-to h2. The
   objective is to dynamically assign customers to idle servers so that
   the expected discounted (or the long-run average) holding cost is
   minimized. We show that a class-j customer should be assigned to an
   idle server in station j, j = 1, 2, whenever possible, and a class-2
   customer should be assigned to an idle server in station 1 only if (no
   class-1 customers are waiting, and) the length of queue 2 exceeds a
   critical number. Moreover, the critical number is monotonically
   increasing in the number of busy servers in station 1. The numerical
   results for some test cases are reported.}},

	Abstract = {{A decision-theoretic framework is proposed for evaluating the
   efficiency of simulation estimators.  The framework includes the cost
   of obtaining the estimate as well as the cost of acting based on the
   estimate.  The cost of obtaining the estimate and the estimate itself
   are represented as realizations of jointly distributed stochastic
   processes.  In this context, the efficiency of a simulation estimator
   based on a given computational budget is defined as the reciprocal of
   the risk (the overall expected cost).  This framework is appealing
   philosophically, but it is often difficult to apply in practice (e.g.,
   to compare the efficiency of two different estimators) because only
   rarely can the efficiency associated with a given computational budget
   be calculated.  However, a useful practical framework emerges in a
   large sample context when we consider the limiting behavior as the
   computational budget increases.  A limit theorem established for this
   model supports and extends a fairly well known efficiency principle,
   proposed by J. M. Hammersley and D. C. Handscomb:  ``The efficiency of
   a Monte Carlo process may be taken as inversely proportional to the
   product of the sampling variance and the amount of labour expended in
   obtaining this estimate.{''}}},

	Abstract = {{In this paper we present a unified framework for simulating Markovian
   models of highly dependable systems. Since the failure event is a rare
   event, the estimation of system dependability measures using standard
   simulation requires very long simulation runs. We show that a variance
   reduction technique called Importance Sampling can be used to speed up
   the simulation by many orders of magnitude over standard simulation.
   This technique can be combined very effectively with regenerative
   simulation to estimate measures such as steady-state availability and
   mean time to failure. Moreover, it can be combined with conditional
   Monte Carlo methods to quickly estimate transient measures such as
   reliability, expected interval availability, and the distribution of
   interval availability. We show the effectiveness of these methods by
   using them to simulate large dependability models. We also discuss how
   these methods can be implemented in a software package to compute both
   transient and steady-state measures simultaneously from the same sample
   run.}},

@article{GurvArmoMand2008,
	Abstract = {{We study large-scale service systems with multiple customer classes and
   many statistically identical servers. The following question is
   addressed: How many servers are required (staffing) and how does one
   match them with customers (control) to minimize staffing cost, subject
   to class-level quality-of-service constraints? We tackle this question
   by characterizing scheduling and staffing schemes that are
   asymptotically optimal in the limit, as system load grows to infinity.
   The asymptotic regimes considered are consistent with the
   efficiency-driven (ED), quality-driven (QD), and
   quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regimes, first introduced in the
   context of a single-class service system.
   Our main findings are as follows: (a) Decoupling of staffing and
   control, namely, (i) staffing disregards the multiclass nature of the
   system and is analogous to the staffing of a single-class system with
   the same aggregate demand and a single global quality-of-service
   constraint, and (ii) class-level service differentiation is obtained by
   using a simple idle-server-based threshold-priority (ITP) control (with
   state-independent thresholds); and (b) robustness of the staffing and
   control rules: our proposed single-class staffing (SCS) rule and ITP
   control are approximately optimal under various problem formulations
   and model assumptions. Particularly, although our solution is shown to
   be asymptotically optimal for large systems, we numerically demonstrate
   that it performs well also for relatively small systems.}},

   discrete or continuous time on a general state space. We develop a
   Liapounov function criterion that permits one to obtain explicit bounds
   on the solution to the Poisson equation and, in particular, obtain
   conditions under which the solution is square integrable.
   These results are applied to obtain sufficient conditions that
   guarantee the validity of a functional central limit theorem for the
   Markov process. As a second consequence of the bounds obtained, a
   perturbation theory for Markov processes is developed which gives
   conditions under which both the solution to the Poisson equation and
   the invariant probability for the process are continuous functions of
   its transition kernel. The techniques are illustrated with applications
   to queueing theory and autoregressive processes.}},

   + sigma dw(t), where w is standard Brownian motion, mu, sigma > 0

   (a) The dividend rate is restricted so that the function a(t) varies in
   {[}0, a(0)] for some a(0) < infinity. It is shown that if a(0) is
   smaller than some critical value, the optimal strategy is to always pay
   the maximal dividend rate no. Otherwise, the optimal policy prescribes
   to pay nothing when the reserve is below some critical level m, and to
   pay maximal dividend rate a(0) when the reserve is above m.
   (b) The dividend rate is unrestriced so that a(t) is allowed to vary in

	Abstract = {{In queueing theory, most models are based on time-homogeneous arrival
   processes and service time distributions. However, in communication
   networks arrival rates and/or the service capacity usually vary
   periodically in time. In order to reflect this property accurately, one
   needs to examine periodic rather than homogeneous queues. In the
   present paper, the periodic BMAP/PH/c queue is analyzed. This queue has
   a periodic BMAP arrival process, which is defined in this paper. and
   phase-type service time distributions. As a Markovian queue, it can be
   analysed like an (inhomogeneous) Markov jump process. The transient
   distribution is derived by solving the Kolmogorov forward equations.
   Furthermore, a stability condition in terms of arrival and service
   rates is proven and for the case of stability, the asymptotic
   distribution is given explicitly. This turns out to be a periodic
   family of probability distributions. It is sketched how to analyze the
   periodic BMAP/M-t/c queue with periodically varying service rates by
   the same method.}},

	Abstract = {{The exact transient distribution of the queue length of the M-t/M-t/1
   single server queue with time-dependent Poisson arrival rate and
   time-dependent exponential service rate was recently obtained by Zhang
   and Coyle {[}63] in terms of a solution to a Volterra equation. Their
   method involved the use of generating functions and complex analysis.
   In this paper, we present an approach that ties the computation of
   these transient distributions directly to the random sample path
   behavior of the M-t/M-t/1 queue. We show the versatility of this method
   by applying it to the M-t/M-t/c multiserver queue, and indicating how
   it can be applied to queues with time-dependent phase arrivals or
   time-dependent phase service.}},

	Abstract = {{We develop an algorithm for computing the (exact) cumulative
   distribution function of the time-dependent workload in a
   piecewise-stationary M-t/G(t)/1 queue with a work-conserving service
   discipline and general service-time distributions, where service times
   are determined at arrival instants. The t subscripts indicate that the
   arrival rate and the general service-time distribution may change with
   time, but we allow changes only at finitely many time points. The
   algorithm is based on numerical transform inversion, using the
   classical Takacs double-transform of the transient workload in an il
   M/G/1 queue recursively over the successive stationary intervals. In
   particular, we apply our recently developed Fourier-series-based
   inversion algorithms for two-dimensional transforms and nested
   one-dimensional transforms. We also do additional work to greatly speed
   up the computation while tightly controlling the error. As a
   consequence, the computation time grows only quadratically with the
   number of intervals. The algorithm is effective for ten or fewer
   intervals, where the intervals may have unlimited and possibly unequal
   lengths, typically running in at most a few minutes and maintaining
   high accuracy. We have also demonstrated that the algorithm can solve a
   21-interval example with 7-to-10-digit accuracy in about half an hour.
   Models with only a few intervals are useful to study overload control
   strategies.}},

	Abstract = {{This paper describes a new continuous-time principal-agent model, in
   which the output is a diffusion process with drift determined by the
   agent's unobserved effort. The risk-averse agent receives consumption
   continuously. The optimal contract, based on the agent's continuation
   value as a state variable, is computed by a new method using a
   differential equation. During employment, the output path
   stochastically drives the agent's continuation value until it reaches a
   point that triggers retirement, quitting, replacement, or promotion.
   The paper explores how the dynamics of the agent's wages and effort, as

@article{BranBran1999,
	Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with the analysis of an s-server queueing system
   wherein the calls may leave the system due to impatience. The
   individual maximal waiting times are assumed to be i.i.d. and
   arbitrarily distributed. The arrival and cumulative service rates may
   depend on the number n of calls in the system, but the service rate is
   assumed to be constant for n > s. For this system, denoted by
   M(n)/M(n)/s + GI, we derive a system of integral equations for the
   vector of the residual maximal waiting times of the waiting calls and
   their original maximal waiting times. By solving these equations
   explicitly we obtain the stability condition and for the steady state
   of the system, the occupancy distribution and various waiting time
   distributions. The results are also new for special cases analyzed in
   earlier papers. As an application of the M(n)/M(n)/ + GI system we give
   a performance analysis of an automatic call distributor system (ACD
   system) of finite capacity with outbound and impatient inbound calls;
   numerical results are given for the case of maximal waiting times as
   the minimum of constant and exponentially distributed times. (C) 1999

@article{GurvWhit2009b,
	Abstract = { In a recent paper we introduced the queue-and-idleness ratio (QIR) family of routing rules for many-server service systems with multiple customer classes and server pools. A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-$c\mu$ ($Gc\mu$) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time. },

@article{YeYao2018,
Abstract = {Multiclass queueing networks (MQN) are, in general, difficult objects to study analytically. The diffusion approximation refers to using the stationary distribution of the diffusion limit as an approximation of the diffusion-scaled process (say, the workload) in the original MQN. To validate such an approximation amounts to justifying the interchange of two limits, t??and k??, with t being the time index and k, the scaling parameter. Here, we show this interchange of limits is justified under a p ?th moment condition on the primitive data, the interarrival and service times; and we provide an explicit characterization of the required order (p*), which depends naturally on the desired order of moment of the workload process.

	Abstract = {The standard fluid model tool is employed to investigate stability behavior in a variant of a generalized Jackson queueing network. In the network, some customers use a join-the-shortest-queue policy when entering the network or moving to the next station. Furthermore, we allow interarrival and service times to have general distributions. For networks with two stations, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for positive Harris recurrence of the network process. These conditions involve only the mean values of the network primitives. Two counterexamplesare provided to show that more information on distributions and tie-breaking probabilities is needed for networks with more than two stations, in order to characterize the stability of such systems. However, if the routing probabilities in the network satisfy a certain homogeneity condition, then it is proved that the stability behavior can be explicitly determined, again using the mean value parameters of the network.},
